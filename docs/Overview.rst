Overview
================================

As mentioned in the Index of this documentation, ScaleHD is a bioinformatics pipeline for use in broad-scope automated genotyping of Huntington Disease (HD) data. The pipeline is made up of four main stages: Sequence Quality Control (SeqQC), Sequence Alignment (SeqALN) and Automated Genotyping (GType). Once a stage has completed, as per user instructions, required information is automatically passed to the next stage (..a pipeline..).

It is designed with UNIX systems in mind, so there is unfortunately no Windows support. Why would you do research on Windows, anyway? For more details about hardware requirements, please see :ref:`sect_reqhard`.

A broad overview of the pipeline stages can be viewed here:
