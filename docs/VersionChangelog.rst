Version ChangeLog
=================

As this software is in continual development, changes will be listed here.
Typically a new release will consist of a collection of minor bugfixes, but occasionally we have to release major overhauls
to modules, include new features, or release hotfixes because I was hungry and mistakenly pushed an update without thorough enough testing.
Don't write code at lunchtime.
